# Kotlin Function

    In Kotlin, functions can be defined both inside and outside of classes.

## Key points
* functions are defined with the fun keyword
* functions are called just like we call Java methods
* function parameters can have default values
* functions can be called with named parameters
* local functions can be created (functions defined within functions)
* infix functions can be created
* extension functions let you extend existing types
* functions don't have to be inside classes, they can be at a package level
